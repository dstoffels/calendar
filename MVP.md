1. (MVP) Print out a calendar in standard grid format
   a. The calendar must display the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) in the first row.
   b. The calendar must be able to start counting dates from a given day of the week.
   c. The calendar must allow for a variable number of days in a month.

2. Allow the user to select the month/year
   a. The calendar will display its grid with the proper starting date for selected month/year.
   b. The user can move forward/backward by one month increments.
   c. The user can quickly display the current month.
   d. Month name and year shall be displayed at the top of the calendar.

3. Improve the calendar's appearance.
   a. Display dates from next/previous months in any open cells of a row.
   b. Change the text color for dates not in the current month, to make them appear 'greyed out'.
   c. Draw grid lines around each cell in the calendar's grid (VERY advanced, major refactor)
